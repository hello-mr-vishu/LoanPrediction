# Load Prediction Project

This project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to predict outcomes based on provided datasets. It includes data visualization and machine learning model implementation to deliver insights and predictions.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for creating insightful plots.
- **Data Processing**: Prepares the dataset using `pandas` for analysis and modeling.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculates accuracy scores to evaluate performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LoadPrediction.git
   cd LoadPrediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional):

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LoadPred.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Visualize the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Example Output

- **Visualization**: Heatmaps and scatterplots to analyze data correlations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy scores and predictions.
